Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    null wide characters â†’ NUL wide characters?

"The B<wcsncpy>()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the "
"B<strncpy>(3)  function.  It copies at most I<n> wide characters from the "
"wide-character string pointed to by I<src>, including the terminating null "
"wide character (L\\[aq]\\e0\\[aq]), to the array pointed to by I<dest>.  "
"Exactly I<n> wide characters are written at I<dest>.  If the length "
"I<wcslen(src)> is smaller than I<n>, the remaining wide characters in the "
"array pointed to by I<dest> are filled with null wide characters.  If the "
"length I<wcslen(src)> is greater than or equal to I<n>, the string pointed "
"to by I<dest> will not be terminated by a null wide character."
