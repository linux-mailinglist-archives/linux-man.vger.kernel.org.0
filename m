Well, as it affects at least 7 man pages, I do not know how such
information should be ideally structured. Whether to be described just
in the readdir(3) and referenced from all others. Or split across all of
them. So I do not think that I'm the one who can prepare patches.

But I will try at least to propose how the changes could look like:

readdir(3) change:

  d_ino - This is the inode number of the directory entry, which belongs
  to the filesystem st_dev of the directory on which was readdir() called.
  If the directory entry is the mount point then the d_ino differs from
  the stat's st_ino. d_ino is the inode number of the underlying mount
  point, rather than of the inode number of mounted file system. According
  to POSIX this Linux behavior is considered to be a bug but conforms as
  "historical implementations".

stat(3type) change:

  st_ino - This field contains the file's inode number, which belongs to
  the st_dev. If the stat() was called on the mount point then st_ino
  differs from the readdir's d_ino. st_ino contains the inode number of
  mounted file system, whether readdir's d_ino contains the inode number
  of the underlying mount point.

So I suggest if somebody else look at it and prepare improvements
including how should be this information structured.
