Oops.  I always doubt when writing words with two y/i in them.
I should run
	dict -m synonim
or
	echo synonim synonym | spell
before typing! :)

As you say, it's not.  I'm now more confused than I was before, so I
will revert this change.

If you feel like you could update the page, since you seem to know more

Thanks for the review!
