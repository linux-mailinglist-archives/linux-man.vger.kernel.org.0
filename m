I would still use DESCRIPTION, I think.  I think we don't lose much by 
using subsections instead, and we gain consistency.

"UTF-8" is an adjective to "characters"; I'd break just after "of", 
since everything after it is a single nominal phrase (I hope I used the 
correct term; I only did syntactical analysis in Spanish at school).

There were more obvious points below that infringed this rule, but I 
wanted to point out the first one.

Okay, looks good to me.

Actually, [4].

Okay, logically it seems good to me; more so when Mathematical language 
already uses that.  I didn't know if it was typically used in prose, as 
I haven't seen its usage in Spanish, but since you referenced a guide 
that recommends its usage, it seems fair.

I'll go for the brackets in the outer ones, as Maths do, as Thaddeus 
did, and as you pointed out, as man references already use () and 
changing those would be weird at least; printf[3] seems like you're 
pointing to a [3] at the bottom of a page.

I have trouble myself when reading those expressions, especially when 
mixing that with another negation.  I have to mentally cancel out 
negations first :D

Okay.

Yes, that's something that could go into man-pages(7).  We had a similar 
discussion about this when designing system_data_types(7).

There, we only cared about the C standard and the POSIX standard, and 
only the first one of each that standardized the type.  If a type were 
only in SUSv4 and not in POSIX, we would use SUSv4 for that type, but 
that hasn't happened yet in the types we documented.

Example:
Conforming to: C99 and later; POSIX.1‐2001 and later.


While we don't have a written rule, I'd use that one for now.
Of course if something is in POSIX.1-2008, it must be in SUSv4 (as it is 
a superset of POSIX), so to simplify, we'll omit that.

Agree.

I like that reasoning.  I'd like to be able to use .P.  But that would 
mean adding even more inconsistency to the man-pages (of course we 
wouldn't change existing pages to use .P at this point).
