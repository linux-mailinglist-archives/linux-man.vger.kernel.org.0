Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    mount or unmount â†’ mount or umount

"This mount shares events with members of a peer group.  Mount and unmount "
"events immediately under this mount will propagate to the other mounts that "
"are members of the peer group.  I<Propagation> here means that the same "
"mount or unmount will automatically occur under all of the other mounts in "
"the peer group.  Conversely, mount and unmount events that take place under "
"peer mounts will propagate to this mount."
