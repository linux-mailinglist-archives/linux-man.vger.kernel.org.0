I understand that manpages for system calls that don't have a libc
wrapper document the use of syscall(SYS_fubar...) to call them.  But
this is an ioctl, not a kernel system call that has no convenient libc
wrapper.  ioctl(2) has been part of the Unix programming manual since
1979 or so, and it's been in Linux since v0.99.  I think we can take for
granted that programmers can figure out 'man -s2 ioctl' if we tell them
to.

So yes, technically an ioctl_XXX manpage should document the fact that
it depends on the existence of an ioctl(fd, number, param...) call, and
that in turn depends on syscall(SYS_ioctl, fd, number, param...) if
somehow ioctl() itself is not available and that in turn depends on
using any of the usual Linux C libraries, but this seems very pedantic
to repeat that for every single ioctl manpage in existence.

IOWS, I think we can take for granted that most C programmers on Linux
are working with a conventional C library, so it's sufficient to put:

SEE ALSO
	ioctl(2)

at the end of an ioctl_XXX manpage like this one.

Why?  There's only one user of this struct, there's no need to waste
people's time making them look up the third ioctl argument in a separate
manpage.  If some other ioctl/syscall/whatever wants to start using
struct fsuuid then yes, this should be hoisted to a separate file so
that both manpages can reference it.
