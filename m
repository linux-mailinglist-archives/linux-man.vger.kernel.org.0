Well, i looked through BSD history first because that's easiest for me,
but it is striking that the authors listed above are not really BSD
people:

 * Larry Wall is the author of perl(1) and not associated with USB or BSD.

 * Jan-Simon Pendry eventually got an account (pendry@) and ultimately
   scored slightly above 1000 commits to BSD, but he was an outside
   contributor and not a member of the CSRG as far as i know.

 * Arnold Robbins joined the GNU awk(1) project in 1988 and eventually
   to over maintenance from Paul Rubin, Jay Fenlason, and RMS.
   Later on, he also contributed to GNU coreutils.
   In fact, the reason his strftime(3) manual page was included
   in 4.4BSD is because it was part of his gawk(1) distribution
   which was included into BSD back then.

 * gzip(1) was also included into BSD as outside code, below contrib/.

The only unambiguous CSRG person in the above list is Keith Bostic,
and by the time he used CAVEATS, the section had already been in use
for more than a decade.

> Would it be correct to say "... section from the BSDs"?

Some might misunderstand even that.  The final CSRG BSD release
only contained about seven instances, all but about two coming
from outside sources, which is not quite what most would expect
hearing "from the BSDs".  Besides, Version 10 AT&T UNIX preceded
4.4BSD-Lite1 by about five years and contained more instances
of CAVEATS.

I dug up some more instances:

 * AT&T SystemÂ III UNIX man(7), released 1982
 * AT&T UNIX, Eighth Edition ksh(1), released February 1985
 * AT&T UNIX, Tenth Edition about seven addition pages, released 1989

So you could say something like this:

  This section has been used in pages written in the man(7) language
  by authors from a wide range of projects including AT&T, Korn shell,
  Perl, GNU and BSD since the early 1980s.
  Using the section was first officially recommended in 2002
  by the file /usr/share/misc/mdoc.template in NetBSD and OpenBSD.

According to my knowledge, that would be accurate.

Yours,
  Ingo
