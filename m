I consider this a bikeshed discussion.

Given that Branden apparently wants to
 * promote .P and deprecate .PP
 * i don't want mandoc_man(7) to gratuitiously spread any more bad
   man(7) style advice than is unavoidable by the fundamental decision
   of declaring the whole man(7) language as obsolete,
i briefly considered changing mandoc_man(7).

Currently it says:

  PP  Begin an undecorated paragraph.  The scope of a paragraph is closed
      by a subsequent paragraph, sub-section, section, or end of file.
      The saved paragraph left-margin width is reset to the default.

  LP  A synonym for PP.

  P   This synonym for PP is an AT&T SystemÂ III UNIX extension later
      adopted by 4.3BSD.

and it declares LP and P deprecated by including only PP in the
MACRO OVERVIEW.

All the arguments feel weak in either direction:

 * In theory, .PP is more portable than .P, but that is extremely
   unlikely to ever matter in practice.
 * As seen above, the similarities and subtle differences
   when comparing to ms(7) can be employed as arguments in either
   direction.
 * The arguably more important similarity that HTML defines a <p>
   but not a <pp> element can be regarded as a learning aid,
   but it's still a weak argument because HTML and roff(7) are
   very different domains and not similar in most other respects.
 * The similarity of .P and <P> can also be turned around to be
   levied as an argument for .PP:  .P and <P> are *very different*
   in so far as <P> is a block element, whereas .P is an in-line
   macro that cannot participate in block nesting.  In particular,
   it can neither nest inside a list item, nor can anything be
   contained inside a .P syntax tree node.  In contrast to <p>,
   .P does not represent a *paragraph*, but only a paragraph *break*.
 * .PP is more similar to mdoc(7) .Pp.  Again, a weak argument because
   macro naming is totally different in both languages even in most
   of the few cases where functionality matches, with the exception
   of only .SH and .SS.

Consequently, i tend to leave mandoc_man(7) just as it is and not
repaint the bikeshed.  That way, the original .PP macro - with which
nothing is really wrong, except for the fundamental design mistake
of not being a block macro, a mistake it shares with mdoc(7) .Pp -
gets the full description, while the slighly younger .P gets the
compat info, even though that now is only of historical but not
of practical interest.  Maybe still nice to keep both apart - gee,
yet another weak argument.

If, for some reason, you feel strongly about it and think it is
important which one to promote, it might be possible to convince me to
deprecate .PP and list .P as the non-deprecated form even though it
is theoretically less portable.  I must admit i don't particularly
like the idea, though.  It feels like taking a gratuitious risk,
which does not feel ideal even if both the magnitude of the risk
and the benefit reaped are almost exactly zero.

Yours,
  Ingo
