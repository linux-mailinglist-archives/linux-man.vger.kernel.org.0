Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    NULL pointer â†’ NULL

"I<argv> is an array of pointers to strings passed to the new program as its "
"command-line arguments.  By convention, the first of these strings (i.e., "
"I<argv[0]>)  should contain the filename associated with the file being "
"executed.  The I<argv> array must be terminated by a NULL pointer.  (Thus, "
"in the new program, I<argv[argc]> will be NULL.)"

"I<envp> is an array of pointers to strings, conventionally of the form "
"B<key=value>, which are passed as the environment of the new program.  The "
"I<envp> array must be terminated by a NULL pointer."
