And as someone with no history of involvement with the man-pages project
(at least as far as I am aware), and seemingly little awareness of the 
history or practices of the project, we should listen to you because...?

To be clear: I ask that provocative question because the strident,
demanding tone of your mail rubs me the wrong way. Please take it
somewhere else than this list.

True, though OSI is in the business of certifying software
licenses, not documentation licenses. That said, I'd have
no problem with someone attempting OSI certification of the
license or doing the mechanics of obtaining an SPDX identifier
for it.

The "verbatim" license has been the most widely used license in
manual pages, almost since the inception of the project 27 years
ago. (Currently more than half of the pages carry this license.)

I don't know the origin of the license (perhaps AEB does),
but as far as I'm concerned, it is a satisfactory license for 
its purpose. And since on the one hand it is, and has been, the
most widely used license and, on the other hand, I am interested
to avoid license proliferation, it's my preferred choice for new
pages. But, as you note, there are other choices:

(Obviously) I have no objection to this license, but currently
about 5% of pages in the project use some flavor of BSD license,
and then mainly because they were lifted straight from a BSD.

Thanks,

Michael
