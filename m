What are "font escapes" and "italic correction escapes"?  I don't know 
those technical terms.

Ahh, I used mgroff(1) (mental groff).  I should debug my mental parser.

So, as I suspected, that .IP is ignored, if my mental groff is working 
correctly now.

Yup.  Since almost when I started here, I'm trying to have the man-pages 
be consistent across all of the pages, both in terms of source code and 
rendered output.  Not an easy thing...

I hope that when I finish this (if it can ever be finished), reading and 
writing man-pages is a simpler task for newbies :)

Regards,

Alex
