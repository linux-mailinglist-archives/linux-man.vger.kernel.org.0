To whom it may concern,


I am having difficulty understanding a sentence in the PRINTF(3) man
page's explanation of the 'a' and 'A' conversion specifiers, more
specifically it is the following sentence:

> The digit before the decimal point is unspecified for nonnormalized numbers, and nonzero but other‚Äêwise unspecified for normalized numbers.


My confusion arises due to the fact that the two posible cases are
described with the same outcome, instead of specifying the outcome is
always the case. This is why I suspect that this
was a case of miswriting.

Did this sentence mean to state that the digit before the decimal
point is unspecified if the number is normalized, otherwise it is
specified? I pose this because the digit cannot be deduced if the
number is not normalized but it can be deduced if the number is
normalized (by definition). I am not familliar with the details since
I am currently trying to learn them, so please let me know if
something else was meant by the sentence in question.


Thank you for your time,

Rohit Saily
