doc/admin-guide: Update perf-security.rst with CAP_PERFMON information

Update perf-security.rst documentation file with the information
related to usage of CAP_PERFMON capability to secure performance
monitoring and observability operations in system.

Committer notes:

While testing 'perf top' under cap_perfmon I noticed that it needs
some more capability and Alexey pointed out cap_ipc_lock, as needed by
this kernel chunk:

  kernel/events/core.c: 6101
       if ((locked > lock_limit) && perf_is_paranoid() &&
               !capable(CAP_IPC_LOCK)) {
               ret = -EPERM;
               goto unlock;
       }

So I added it to the documentation, and also mentioned that if the
libcap version doesn't yet supports 'cap_perfmon', its numeric value can
be used instead, i.e. if:

	# setcap "cap_perfmon,cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_syslog=ep" perf

Fails, try:

	# setcap "38,cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_syslog=ep" perf

I also added a paragraph stating that using an unpatched libcap will
fail the check for CAP_PERFMON, as it checks the cap number against a
maximum to see if it is valid, which makes it use as the default the
'cycles:u' event, even tho a cap_perfmon capable perf binary can get
kernel samples, to workaround that just use, e.g.:

  # perf top -e cycles
  # perf record -e cycles

And it will sample kernel and user modes.
