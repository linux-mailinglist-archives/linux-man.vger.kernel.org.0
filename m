Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue 1:  alphabetic?
Issue 2:  multiple cases â†’ both cases?

"If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as if all case "
"distinctions had vanished from the alphabet.  When an alphabetic that exists "
"in multiple cases appears as an ordinary character outside a bracket "
"expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression "
"containing both cases, for example, \\[aq]x\\[aq] becomes \"I<[xX]>\".  When "
"it appears inside a bracket expression, all case counterparts of it are "
"added to the bracket expression, so that, for example, \"I<[x]>\" becomes "
"\"I<[xX]>\" and \"I<[\\[ha]x]>\" becomes \"I<[\\[ha]xX]>\"."
