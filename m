Do we want similar comments in struct sockaddr and/or sockaddr_XX?

Existing POSIX already requires sockaddr_storage to be suitably sized
and aligned to overlay with all other sockaddr* types.  What the
recent POSIX bug change does is add wording to emphasize that casts in
any of the 6 directions:

sockaddr* <-> sockaddr_XX*
sockaddr_storage* <-> sockaddr*
sockaddr_storage* <-> sockaddr_XX*

must allow the sa_family/ss_family/sa_family_t member to overlay
without triggering undefined behavior due to bad aliasing, at which
point, access to that member lets you deduce what other object type
you really have.  But you are also correct that merely casting a
pointer to another larger struct that doesn't trigger aliasing, but
then dereferencing beyond the bounds of the original, is not intended
to be portable.  The aliasing diagnostics are suppressed because of
the requirements on the first member, so now the user must now be
careful that their access of remaining members is safe even if the
compiler is no longer helping them because of the magic that
suppressed the aliasing detection.

I agree with your warning that code that can handle generic socket
types should use sockaddr_storage (and not sockaddr) as the original
object (the one object that the standard requires to be suitably sized
and aligned to overlay with the entirety of all other sockaddr types,
rather than just the sa_family_t first member), although we may want
to be more precise that code using a specific protocol type can
directly use the proper sockaddr_XX type rather than having to use an
intermediate sockaddr_storage.

I'm not sure if there are better ways to word that paragraph to convey
the intended sentiment.

I'm less certain about this one.  The POSIX wording specifically chose
to keep existing API/ABI of sockaddr* in all the standardized
functions unchanged, as it would be too invasive to existing code to
change the signatures now.  The burden is on the system headers to
define types so that the necessary casts (present in lots of existing
code because sockaddr* has a bit more type-safety than void*) do not
of themselves cause aliasing issues, and therefore avoid undefined
behavior provided subsequent code accessing through the pointers is
not accessing beyond the bounds of the real object.  The likelihood of
POSIX adding new socket APIs taking sockaddr_storage* just to enforce
non-aliasing seems slim.  But then again, this advice applies to more
than just functions likely to be standardized in a future libc, so
maybe this paragraph is worth it after all.
