Hello dear,with the grace of God I have to find strength and courage
from my sick bed to write you today before is too late. I was married
to late Engineer, Jean-Paul George, a Swiss expatriate and a
businessman who based and work in Abidjan for the period of 21 years.
As faith may have it our marriage ended without any children my
husband died in a car accident in Abu Dhabi on a business trip to
United ArabEmirates.


When my husband was alive, after our last visit to your country we
both agree to donate some money to help the less privileged children
and set up a orphanage home but this plan was chartered by the death
of my husband. I am a woman who believes in God and helping the less
privileged for the love of God.

According to the doctors report I have very little time to live
because I am suffering from cancer is very painful but I still trust
and believe in God for miracle.I wish to donate the sum of Nine
Hundred and Eighty Thousand Euro currently in a financial company to
your care for this charity project. I will stop hear as I want to take
some rest now, Please always put me in your prayers, I am looking
forward for your response.


Greeting from

Sister. Erena Matt George.
