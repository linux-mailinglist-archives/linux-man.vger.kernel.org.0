But I mean F_SETDELEG (with an S).  I expect the setter wouldn't modify,
right?

Ahhh, sorry!  I see why.  So, we have EX/EE nested within nf/fi.  These
don't nest correctly, so one should close nf/fi, then do EX/EE, and then
open a new nf/fi pair.

I was supposing you had done that, but didn't figure out from which.  :)
Now it makes sense.  Yes, I should remove that from
F_GETLEASE.man2const.  It is a left-over from when I split the page
=66rom fcntl(2).

This applies also to the rest of the page, BTW.

Ahhh, so this is already a historical thing.  Indeed:

	$ grep -rn F_RDLCK man/
	man/man2const/F_GETLEASE.2const:45:.B F_RDLCK
	man/man2const/F_GETLEASE.2const:89:.BR F_RDLCK ", " F_WRLCK ", or " F_UNLC=
K ,
	man/man2const/F_GETLEASE.2const:123:.BR F_RDLCK .
	man/man2const/F_GETLEASE.2const:133:.B F_RDLCK
	man/man2/fcntl_locking.2:52:    short l_type;    /* Type of lock: F_RDLCK,
	man/man2/fcntl_locking.2:123:.RB ( F_RDLCK )
	man/man2/fcntl_locking.2:143:.B F_RDLCK
	man/man2/fcntl_locking.2:360:.B F_RDLCK

I guess that answers my question: no, we can't rename these.
Let's keep the historical names.

Hmm, I see the F_SETLEASE page doesn't document those either.

I think it would be good to document the errors, and in F_GETLEASE too,
if you can.  (Feel free to leave that for a later patch.)
