Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    from background job â†’ from a background job

"At most one of the jobs in a session may be the I<foreground job>; other "
"jobs in the session are I<background jobs>.  Only the foreground job may "
"read from the terminal; when a process in the background attempts to read "
"from the terminal, its process group is sent a B<SIGTTIN> signal, which "
"suspends the job.  If the B<TOSTOP> flag has been set for the terminal (see "
"B<termios>(3)), then only the foreground job may write to the terminal; "
"writes from background job cause a B<SIGTTOU> signal to be generated, which "
"suspends the job.  When terminal keys that generate a signal (such as the "
"I<interrupt> key, normally control-C)  are pressed, the signal is sent to "
"the processes in the foreground job."
