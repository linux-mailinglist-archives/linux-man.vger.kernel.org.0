What kind of manual pages?

That sounds very foolish on several levels.

First, and most obviously, you seem to be duplicating esr@'s work
on doclifter:

  http://www.catb.org/~esr/doclifter/
  https://gitlab.com/esr/doclifter/-/blob/master/doclifter

Second, quick and dirty Perl-style parsing is usually not good
enough to parse roff code, and a huge script is not particularly
good for readability and maintainability.

Yes, i know the same resevations would apply to esr@'s work,
which is a giant Python 3 script.  But at least there is some
evidence that his work was able to find significant numbers of
real issues in real manual pages.

Yikes.  That thing is by far the worst man(7) code generator existing
on this planet.  If at all possible, you should avoid that toolchain
like the plague.

It is so bad that for years, bogus reports caused by that totally
broken toolchain have caused the majority of invalid mandoc bug
reports.

> The end result you get is standardized 'roff, whatever that means.

Absolutely not.  The result is utter crap.  It is rarely even
syntactically valid, let alone reasonable style.

That isn't completely untrue, but all the same, mandoc copes well
enough with more than 95% of valid real-world manual pages, and groff
with 100%.  In a nutshell, the only stuff that breaks with groff
is manual pages that are completely invalid, usually coming from
the official DocBook XML toolchain, and in rarer cases coming from
other broken man(7) generators.

All this is barely related to the question of standardizing roff(7),
though.  Roff is much more than manual pages.

Yours,
  Ingo
