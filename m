Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue 1:  The same is also of other â†’ The same is true also for other
Issue 2:  Missing full stop at the end

"In order to determine permissions when an unprivileged process accesses a "
"file, the process credentials (UID, GID) and the file credentials are in "
"effect mapped back to what they would be in the initial user namespace and "
"then compared to determine the permissions that the process has on the "
"file.  The same is also of other objects that employ the credentials plus "
"permissions mask accessibility model, such as System V IPC objects"
