 A

Once watered, you'll just need to wait.
3.      Harvest Your Bounty: Once the crops are ripe (usually shown by a vi=

4.      Stock the Shelves: Drag your harvested crops from the field to the
designated shelf. Your customers will automatically start buying them.
5.      Earn Money: As customers purchase your products, you'll earn money.

character with the money to carry more items at once to be more efficient.

complexity to your business.
