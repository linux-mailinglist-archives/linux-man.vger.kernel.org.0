The glibc implementation wraps getline(3) and therefore  doesn't truncate the passphrase or overflow a fixed-size buffer, no matter how long the input is, but portable code cannot rely on that.  And come to think of it, using getline(3) means that prefixes of the passphrase may be left lying around in malloc's free lists.

Also, it relies on the caller to size the buffer for the passphrase, and therefore risks truncating people's passphrases.

The conclusion I came to is that the easy changes are all putting lipstick on a pig, and if I was going to work on this at all I was going to design a privilege-separated authentication service that could be asked to take over a tty, read a passphrase, check it, and return just success or failure to the caller.  Neither the passphrase itself, nor any strings derived from it, would ever be in the caller's address space.  But this is obviously well out of scope for the C library.

I happen to be working on replacing getpass(3) in shadow-utils.  As 
there is no replacement in glibc, I'm making the code depend on libbsd 
on GNU systems.

I developed a function similar to getpass(3), but which allocates a 
buffer (similar to asprintf(3)).  I only allocate once, and bail out if 
the password exceeds PASS_MAX, so no leaks in allocated memory (modulo 
bugs that I may have not noticed).

I also enforce both clearing and freeing the memory, by requiring a 
specific clean-up function.

The prototypes for the function and the clean-up are:

```
void erase_pass(char *p);
[[gnu::malloc(erase_pass)]] char *shdw_getpass(const char *prompt);

```

And the implementation is:

```
#include "prototypes.h"

#include <limits.h>
#include <readpassphrase.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


#if !defined(PASS_MAX)
#define PASS_MAX  BUFSIZ
#endif


char *
agetpass(const char *prompt)
{
	char    *p;
	size_t  len;

	p = malloc(PASS_MAX);
	if (p == NULL)
		return NULL;

	if (readpassphrase(prompt, p, PASS_MAX, 0) == NULL)
		goto fail;

	len = strlen(p);

	if (len == 0)
		return p;

	if (p[len - 1] != '\n')
		goto truncated;

	p[len - 1] = '\0';

	return p;

truncated:
	memzero(p, PASS_MAX);
fail:
	free(p);
	return NULL;
}


void
erase_pass(char *p)
{
	if (p != NULL)
		memzero(p, PASS_MAX);
	free(p);
}
```


Would you mind implementing readpassphrase(3) in glibc so that it's 
easier to use something safe and portable without resorting to 
compatibility libraries?  Also, I'd like some review of this function, 
if you think the API could be improved.  Maybe agetpass() would be a 
simple almost-drop-in replacement for getpass(3), so if you like it for 
glibc, let's discuss it.

I chose a predefined buffer size to not have to pass a buffer size all 
the time, which could be error-prone.  I also allocated the buffer 
internally, to make it easier to replace getpass(3).  It may be 
desirable to use existing buffers, and pass them through a pointer, but 
for shadow-utils, it was simpler to keep the getpass(3) API.

I don't know what was the practice with PASS_MAX regarding the NUL byte, 
but to avoid creating a buffer of a power of two plus one, I decided 
that the NUL byte would be within PASS_MAX.  Another solution would be 
to declare PASS_MAX to be something like BUFSIZ-1, and then use 
PASS_MAX+1, but I opted for simplicity.

What are your thoughts?

Cheers,

Alex
