Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    ISO 10646 â†’ ISO/IEC 10646

"Unicode (ISO 10646) is a standard which aims to unambiguously represent "
"every character in every human language.  Unicode's structure permits 20.1 "
"bits to encode every character.  Since most computers don't include 20.1-bit "
"integers, Unicode is usually encoded as 32-bit integers internally and "
"either a series of 16-bit integers (UTF-16) (needing two 16-bit integers "
"only when encoding certain rare characters) or a series of 8-bit bytes "
"(UTF-8)."

"A byte 110xxxxx is the start of a 2-byte code, and 110xxxxx 10yyyyyy is "
"assembled into 00000xxx xxyyyyyy.  A byte 1110xxxx is the start of a 3-byte "
"code, and 1110xxxx 10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz is assembled into xxxxyyyy yyzzzzzz.  "
"(When UTF-8 is used to code the 31-bit ISO 10646 then this progression "
"continues up to 6-byte codes.)"
