- Fix SYNOPSIS to fit in 78 columns

  Also, we don't show when an include is included for a specific type,
  unless that header is included _only_ for the type,
  or there might be confusion (e.g., termios).
  Instead, that type should be documented in system_data_types(7),
  with a link page mount_attr-struct(3).

- Fix references to mount_setattr().  See man-pages(7):

       Any reference to the subject of the current manual page should be writ‚Äê
       ten with the name in bold followed by a pair of  parentheses  in  Roman
       (normal)  font.   For  example, in the fcntl(2) man page, references to
       the subject of the page would be written as:  fcntl().   The  preferred
       way to write this in the source file is:

           .BR fcntl ()

- Fix line breaks according to semantic newline rules (and add some commas)
- Fix wrong usage of .IR when .RI should have been used
- Fix formatting of variable part in FOO<number>:
  - Make italic the variable part (as groff_man(7) recommends)
  - Remove <>
  - Use syntax recommended by G. Branden Robinson (groff)

- Fix unnecessary uses of .BR or .IR when .B or .I would suffice
- Fix formatting of punctuation

  In some cases, it was in italics or bold, and it should always be in roman.

- Use uppercase to begin text, even in bullet points, since those were
  multi-sentence.

- Simplify usage of .RS/.RE in combination with .IP
- s/fat/FAT/ as fs(7) does
- Slightly reword some sentences for consistency
- Use Linux-specific for consistency with other pages (in VERSIONS)
- EXAMPLES: Place the return type in a line of its own (as in other pages)
- Fix alignment of code
- Replace unnecessary use of the GNU extension ({}) by do {} while (0)

  In that case, there was no return value (moreover, it's a noreturn).

- Break complex declaration lines into a line for each variable

  The variables were being initialized, some to non-zero values,
  so for clarity, a line for each one seems more appropriate.

- Remove unmatched groff commands

Hi, Christian!

I applied your v4 patch.
On top of it I applied this fix.
Could you please check that the non-whitespace non-formatting
changes are correct?
Also, please have a look at the whitespace and formatting fixes :)

Thanks!

Alex
