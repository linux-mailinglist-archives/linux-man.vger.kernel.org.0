Thanks.=20

We are working with what our upstreams provide, and especially
archlinux tries to update frequently (but we might lag a few weeks
behind them), so from time to time the issue might already been fixed.
Due to the sheer size of upstreams and man pages and potential issues
to be fixed we unfortunately might occasionally thus report issues
already dealt with by you (or your fellow maintainers of other
projects).

Sorry for the noise.

Greetings

          Helge
