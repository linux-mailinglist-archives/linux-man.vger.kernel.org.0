Issue:    shopuld â†’ should

"Ideally, a library for the C language is designed such that each header file "
"presents the interface to a coherent software module.  It provides a small "
"number of function declarations and exposes only data types and constants "
"that are required for use of those functions.  Together, these are termed an "
"API or I<application program interface>.  Types and constants to be shared "
"among multiple APIs shopuld be placed in header files that declare no "
"functions.  This organization permits a C library module to be documented "
"concisely with one header file per manual page.  Such an approach improves "
"the readability and accessibility of library documentation, and thereby the "
"usability of the software."
