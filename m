hi Alejandro

Apologies for the delay.

Are you in touch with Michael Kerrisk? In the past we have worked with him and made a permissions grant - which outlines the terms we are able to grant â€” these are limited
by the copyright holders. 
It also appeared in discussions with Michael in 2020, that he had a way to convert the source format to man page format.
regards
Andrew
