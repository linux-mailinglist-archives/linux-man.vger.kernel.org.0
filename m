Thanks for the further clarifications.

All: I plan to add the following text to the manual page:

       new_root and put_old may be the same  directory.   In  particular,
       the following sequence allows a pivot-root operation without need‚Äê
       ing to create and remove a temporary directory:

           chdir(new_root);
           pivot_root(".", ".");
           umount2(".", MNT_DETACH);

       This sequence succeeds because the pivot_root()  call  stacks  the
       old root mount point (old_root) on top of the new root mount point
       at /.  At that point, the calling  process's  root  directory  and
       current  working  directory  refer  to  the  new  root mount point
       (new_root).  During the subsequent umount()  call,  resolution  of
       "."   starts  with  new_root  and then moves up the list of mounts
       stacked at /, with the result that old_root is unmounted.

Look okay?

Thanks,

Michael
