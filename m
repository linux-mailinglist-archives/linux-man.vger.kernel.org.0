It wasn't "lucky". "Do one thing and do it well" was an explicit design 
decision the Bell Labs guys made in 1971. Doug McIlroy wrote about it in 
1978 in the Forward to the article on "The Unix TimeSharing System" in 
the Bell System Technical Journal in 1978: "do one thing and do it well" 
and then compose more complicated things from simple parts. Peter Salus 
reiterated it in "a quarter century of unix" (a book about the 
anniversary), and Mike Gancarz' book "the unix philosophy" went into 
this in some detail.

That's why they could get away with a flat namespace and simple man 
pages and so on for decades.

Gnu's Not Unix in quite a number of ways.

The utility command line parameters are on the web at 
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/intro.1.html which seemed 
reasonably straightforward to me. (Over the years it's accumulated a lot 
of extra crap from optional packages, but as failure modes go it could 
be worse...)

The kernel command line arguments are at 
https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt 
and filesystems are at 
https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/squashfs.txt (first 
I've heard pseudo, it's usually called "synthetic", ala 
https://landley.net/toybox/doc/mount.html unless you have a reference I 
don't?)

But then I was briefly the linux kernel's Documentation maintainer in a 
previous life so I may be biased. (Jonathan Corbet of lwn.net has that 
position now, I believe.) I did a certain amount of analysis back when 
it was my job, ala https://kernel.org/doc/ols/2008/ols2008v2-pages-7-18.pdf

The man pages present simple text output created from text input. The 
source is in a legacy typesetting format from 1971 (created for the AT&T 
patent and licensing department and aimed at a brand of daisy-wheel 
printer that no longer exists), but even 
http://www.catb.org/~esr/doclifter/doclifter.html back in 2003 could 
already migrate that to something else and people decided "nah, qwerty 
ain't so bad, better the devil you know...".

People were offered docbook 20 years ago. It was worse. (There's no 
docbook gui editor because it's TOO structured, in ways that are not 
easily visually represented. It's an ivory tower academic solution.)

The man package's build scripts have produced html output for many 
years, you can do it on your laptop from a git clone.

If I want "man insmod" I don't have to know it's in section 8. Making it 
more granular turns out to be less useful.

You're complaining about 40 year old design decisions that have 
persisted for good reason. People have been free to change it all along.

Either people updated the docs or they didn't. Having an active 
well-known place to go look and complain at is useful. Requiring 
somebody to read the source code and provide a copyright assignment to 
tweak documentation... well you've tried that since 1983, how did it go?

There may be some selection bias in the people who constantly read and 
edit this source code finding this source code to be the best place to 
put the docs. Learn to cook at the oven factory.
