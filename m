+.SS Truncating files
+The operations covered by
+.B LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE
+and
+.B LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE
+both change the contents of a file and sometimes overlap in
+non-intuitive ways.
+It is recommended to always specify both of these together.
+.PP
+A particularly surprising example is
+.BR creat (2).
+The name suggests that this system call requires
+the rights to create and write files.
+However, it also requires the truncate right
+if an existing file under the same name is already present.
+.PP
+It should also be noted that truncating files does not require the
+.B LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE
+right.
+Apart from the
+.BR truncate (2)
+system call, this can also be done through
+.BR open (2)
+with the flags
+.IR "O_RDONLY\ |\ O_TRUNC" .
+.PP
+When opening a file, the availability of the
+.B LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE
+right is associated with the newly created file descriptor
+and will be used for subsequent truncation attempts using
+.BR ftruncate (2).
+The behavior is similar to opening a file for reading or writing,
+where permissions are checked during
+.BR open (2),
+but not during the subsequent
+.BR read (2)
+and
+.BR write (2)
+calls.
+.PP
+As a consequence,
+it is possible to have multiple open file descriptors for the same file,
+where one grants the right to truncate the file and the other does not.
+It is also possible to pass such file descriptors between processes,
+keeping their Landlock properties,
+even when these processes do not have an enforced Landlock ruleset.
