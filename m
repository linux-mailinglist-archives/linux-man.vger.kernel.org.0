payment/consignment (box) from criminal who is trying to redirect the
delivery of your consignment to another address which totally
different from yours.

This criminal stated that you gave him Authority To Change the
delivery address to Charity Home because you are infected by Corona
Virus Pandemic and you cannot survive, but as Detective I am, it

consignment without your permission and we decided to contact you and
confirm from you if you permitted him to redirect the delivery of your
consignment or not before we can release him with your consignment.

Please are you aware of changing the delivery of your consignment
(box) to another destination?

NOTE: this consignment (box) retrieved from the criminal during our
last routine inspection and suspected to be banking instruments worth
millions of United States Dollar notes in cash as indicated on the
consignment papers.

Reply immediately we want to know if you authorized him to change the
delivery of your consignment/box to another destination or not.

Get back to me.
