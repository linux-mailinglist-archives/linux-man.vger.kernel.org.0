Okay.  Then may I ask for an EXAMPLES section with a program that 
unequivocally shows users how to use it?

I prefer types in separate pages, as the information is organized, and 
also because it allows to `man 2type fsuuid` if you want to see 
information about the type without knowing what the type is for (e.g., 
you've seen the type in some random code, maybe far from its 
corresponding ioctl(2) use, and want to understand it).

But `man fsuuid` can also be accomplished if we add a link page (see 
e.g. int8_t.3type for how to do it), if you prefer that.

Thanks,

Alex
