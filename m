Gavin will tell, but AFAIU our plan is to develop js as the means
towards the goals you mentioned.  That will allow using HTML browsers
to read Texinfo documentation without losing the functionalities of
the Info readers we value.  HTML rendering reflows as integral part of
its workings, so that problem is not an issue if this plan succeeds.
