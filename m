Whoops, I ought to have removed this part of the commit message, since
I updated the commit to mention shmem as well:

"This patch covers just the hugetlbfs implementation (in 5.13). Support
for shmem is forthcoming, but as it has not yet made it into a kernel
release candidate, it will be added in a future commit."
