I think this should be documented the other way around -- adding
EOPNOTSUPP to the list of errors, with a note that applications may
not see the error due to emulation by glibc, but should be prepared to
handle it. The emulation glibc does is highly unsafe (can corrupt the
file -- see https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15661) and
the only reason it wasn't removed was that software had come to rely
on it being there, in part due to lack of documentation otherwise. If
that's fixed, it's possible that glibc could eventually fix this bug
with a new symbol version.
