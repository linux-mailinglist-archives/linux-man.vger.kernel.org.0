In 3b9d44099f234e8e, the long sentence was replaced with this paragraph:

"A signal may be process-directed or thread-directed. A process-directed 
signal is one that is targeted at (and thus pending for) the process as 
a whole. A signal may be process-directed because it was generated by 
the kernel for reasons other than a hardware exception, or because it 
was sent using kill(2) or sigqueue(3). A thread-directed signals is one 
that is targeted at a specific thread. A signal may be thread-directed 
because it was generated as a consequence of executing a specific 
machine-language instruction that triggered a hardware exception (e.g., 
SIGSEGV for an invalid memory access, or SIGFPE for a math error), or 
because it was it was targeted at a specific thread using interfaces 
such as tgkill(2) or pthread_kill(3).
