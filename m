Hello,


when skimming through the reported bugs at man-pages bugzilla I tried to 
tag a few bug reports with personal tags for my own workflow and own 
custom search filters (something like to_triage, to_ask and to_do).

When I added one tag and saved that changes I got an:

Changes submitted for bug 205763
Email sent to:
inout@users.sourceforge.net, on2014nm@gmail.com, 
zeno.endemann@googlemail.com


Wondering, isn't the field personal tag meant only for me? I thought it 
should not sent out notifications. At least that is what the description 
of the field is saying. Am I doing something wrong here or do I have to 
configure something at my settings of bugzilla?



Thanks in advance,
Thomas
