I do as well[1]; while I haven't yet encountered a situation where it
seemed sensible to dispose of it, I would lend writers of section 7
pages that freedom.

I'm a little uneasy with some of the hacks I've seen to contrive
sub-subsections in man pages.  I saw one within the past few months but
can't remember the specifics.  Sending this mail may prompt my
recollection since that's how my memory seems to work.  I'll follow up
if it does.

Ah, that's a "phrase" rather than a "clause".  The terms are
distinguished in traditional (schoolhouse) English grammar; loosely, a
"phrase" is a set of words operating as a "part of speech" (noun, verb,
adjective, adverb) whereas a "clause" is a group of phrases with a
"subject" and a "predicate".  Generally, sentence can be decomposed into
one or more clauses, each of which can itself be expressed as a sentence
with little or no recasting.

There's nothing about phrases or phrase boundaries in the guidance
quoted above.  At first blush I would recommend against adding it
because it's harder to find such boundaries automatically.  When I
revise man pages in the groff project it's easy to find clause
boundaries with the vi search pattern "/[;!?.]."  (I usually add a
comma and a closing parenthesis to this pattern because I also prefer to
break after commas and multi-word parentheticals, but I'm not militant
about prescribing this expanded sense of semantic newlines.))

Someone trained in linguistics at the university level could doubtless
speak about this subject with much greater precision.  (And then there's
Huddleston and Pullum's iconoclastic _Cambridge Grammar of the English
Language_...)

I don't think most native English speakers are likely to interpret the
semantic newline rule as you do because we absorb a different denotation
of "clause" when we're taught elementary formal grammar.

I goofed up the point I was trying to make here.  I provided a duplicate
example of the case I attributed to Thaddeus.  Let me try that again.

Overflow is guaranteed for a sufficiently large
=2ERI integer\~ n .

Hah!  I need a footnote assistance plug-in for Vim.  I'm sure someone
will tell me that Emacs org-mode does this for them.

Indeed so.  In the next release of groff, ms will bracket footnotes like
this automatically in nroff mode (that is, for terminal output)[2].  I
recently noticed that the me(7) package does not, and I think it should.

It's a tough problem.  When I was learning Spanish I had trouble
acquiring the practice of reinforcing negatives in sentences ("No
tenemos [no] dios, no tenemos [no] jefes."[??])  How many negatives do I
need?  When do I stop?

Getting back to English, I would be over the moon if my fellow native
speakers would quit misrepresenting the logical negation of "all horses
are animals" as "all horses are not animals".  You see and hear this all
the time, notoriously from journalists.

Granted.  What I do with groff's man pages is that I tend to queue up
style fixes (mentally if nothing else), applying them when I have a
content fix to make to a page.  Over time, things settle into a new
consistency, but patience is required if churn or flag days are to be
avoided.

I'm glad you're still there!

Branden
