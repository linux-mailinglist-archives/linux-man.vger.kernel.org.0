The constants are correct.

Quoting myself: "The use of the string _MAX in the limit names 
defined by SUSv3 can appear confusing, given their description as minimum 
values. The rationale for the names becomes clear when we consider that each 
of these constants defines an upper limit on some resource or feature, and
the standards are saying that this upper limit must have a certain 
minimum value."

Michael
