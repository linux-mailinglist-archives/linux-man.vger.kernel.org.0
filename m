I think you and I missed that discussion:

I still think it's redundant to say that you have to link against the
standard C library -- it's a standard feature on Linux, and you have to
pass -nolibc to opt out of it.  Libraries that have to be opted-into
(e.g. -lpthread) should be documented here, but not stuff that's enabled
by default.

Oh well, you're the maintainer, it is your prerogative.

That would've helped, since I scanned
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man-pages.7.html
and didn't see much about what goes in this section...

Frankly I'd rather push people to have example code over documenting
that standard C library functions require the standard C library. :)

That said, I don't always enjoy the textbook examples that have been
slimmed down for manpages -- I prefer a link to a real implementation
in (say) the test suite so that I can see code that (one would hope)
exercises all the functionality exposed through the interface.

But I guess that's really up to the manpage author to decide.

I'm not convinced that having to open *two* manpages just to figure out
how to call an ioctl is going to simplify maintenance unless the struct
is shared across more than one manpage, but I've already made that
point.

(There isn't any magical way to #include a manpage within another
manpage, is there?)
