I believe that you've misapprehended things slightly. I think the
correct summary is this:

1. If the process "dumpable" attribute is not 1, the files in
   /proc/PID are owned by root:root. If the dumpable attribute is 1,
   then the ownership is <process-eUID>:<process-eGID>. (And in
   a set-UID-root program, <process-eUID> is of course "root".)

2. As described in prctl(2), various process credential changes
   may cause the value of the process's dumpable attribute to
   be reset to the value in /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable (which
   typically has the value 0).

So, if I understand the scenario you are describing correctly:

(a) We run a set-UID program. Consequently, the process's dumpable
    flag is reset to the value in /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
    (probably 0) and consequently the ownership of the /proc/PID
    files changes to root:root.
(b) [Hypothetically] the process uses prctl(2) to reset the
    dumpable flag to 1. This causes the ownership of the
    /proc/PID files to reset to <process-eUID>:<process-eGID>.
(c) The process drops its effective UID back to the same value as
    the real UID, which brings us back to the same state as in (a).
(d) The process uses prctl(2) to reset the dumpable flag to 1.
    This would again cause the ownership of the /proc/PID files
    to reset to <process-eUID>:<process-eGID>.

Rule 1 above is I think quite clearly captured in proc(5):

       The  files  inside  each /proc/[pid] directory are normally
       owned by the effective user and effective group ID  of  the
       process.   However, as a security measure, the ownership is
       made root:root if the process's "dumpable" attribute is set
       to a value other than 1.

But people trip up over point (c), I think. The question is how
to better alert them, so that they don't trip up. As a step in
that direction, I added some text in proc(5):

       Resetting  the "dumpable" attribute to 1 reverts the owner‚Äê
       ship of the /proc/[pid]/* files to the process's  effective
x      UID  and  GID.  Note, however, that if the effective UID or
x      GID is subsequently modified, then the "dumpable" attribute
x      may  be reset, as described in prctl(2).  Therefore, it may
x      be desirable to reset the "dumpable" attribute after making
x      any desired changes to the process's effective UID or GID.

If you have specific suggestions about other changes that could
be made to prevent the misunderstanding that you had, please
let me know.

Thanks,

Michael
