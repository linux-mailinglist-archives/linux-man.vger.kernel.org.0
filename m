Even though the RFW_* flags were first introduced in Linux 4.6, they
could not be used with aio until 4.13 where the aio_rw_flags field was
added to struct iocb (9830f4be159b "fs: Use RWF_* flags for AIO
operations"). Correct the stated version for each flag.

Fixes: 2f72816f8680 ("io_submit.2: Add kernel version numbers for various 'aio_rw_flags' flags")
