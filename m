Good to know, I couldn't find read.1p in the repository.  But at the
bottom of read.1p it says:

"Any typographical or formatting errors that appear in this page are
most likely to have been introduced during the conversion of the
source files to man page format.  To report such errors, see
https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/reporting_bugs.html. "

I think this might make people want to report such bugs here.  Also, I
also wasn't able to find any mention of austingroupbugs.net neither in
man-pages-posix-2013-a/README nor at
https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages except for this
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/changelog.html (at least using
Google's site: operator).  Could this information be put somewhere?

Here http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1158 someone says that the
issue is already solved in `troff source' but I don't know where to
get it.

That didn't work for me because /etc/groff/man.local is never opened:

$ strace -f /usr/bin/man ./read.1p |& grep 'man.local'
[pid 13682] open("/home/ja/man.local", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 13682] open("/usr/lib64/groff/site-tmac/man.local", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 13682] open("/usr/share/groff/site-tmac/man.local", O_RDONLY) = 5

Adding .char \- \N'45' to ~/man.local didn't help.  And I already have
this in /usr/share/groff/site-tmac/man.local:

.  \" Map \- to the Unicode HYPHEN-MINUS character, to make
.  \" searching in man pages easier.
.  if '\*[.T]'utf8' \
.    char \- \N'45'

I have a hard time trying to understand the whole process and need
some reading on the subject.

$ troff -v
GNU troff (groff) version 1.22.3
