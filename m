Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    ISO 8859 â†’ ISO/IEC 8859

"For most texts in ISO 8859 character sets, this means that the characters "
"outside of ASCII are now coded with two bytes.  This tends to expand "
"ordinary text files by only one or two percent.  For Russian or Greek texts, "
"this expands ordinary text files by 100%, since text in those languages is "
"mostly outside of ASCII.  For Japanese users this means that the 16-bit "
"codes now in common use will take three bytes.  While there are algorithmic "
"conversions from some character sets (especially ISO 8859-1) to Unicode, "
"general conversion requires carrying around conversion tables, which can be "
"quite large for 16-bit codes."
