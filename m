What about offering a compile-time option to enable or disable such code?=20
Note, with the existing random.c code base, there is no need to have a=20
separate blocking_pool. The ChaCha20 DRNG could be used for that very same=
=20
purpose, provided that in case these true random numbers are generated when=
=20
the Chacha20 DRNG received an equal amount of "unused" entropy.

With the patch set v26 of my LRNG I offer another possible alternative=20
avoiding any additional character device file and preventing the starvation=
 of=20
legitimate use cases: the LRNG has an entropy pool that leaves different=20
levels of entropy in the pool depending on the use cases of this data.

If an unprivileged caller requests true random data, at least 1024 bits of=
=20
entropy is left in the pool. I.e. all entropy above that point is available=
=20
for this request type. Note, even namespaces fall into this category=20
considering that unprivileged users can create a user name space in which t=
hey=20
can become root.

If a non-blocking DRNG serving /dev/urandom or getrandom(2) needs reseeding=
,=20
at least 512 bits of entropy is left in the pool. Each DRNG seeding operati=
on=20
requires at least 128 bits and at most 256 bits of entropy. This means that=
 at=20
least 2 reseed operations worth of entropy is found in the entropy pool eve=
n=20
though massive amount of true random numbers are requested by unprivileged=
=20
users.

If a privileged caller requests true random numbers, the entropy pool is=20
allowed to be exhausted.

Access to the true random number generator is provided with getrandom(2) an=
d=20
the GRND_TRUERANDOM flag. If the true random number generator (TRNG) is not=
=20
compiled or not present, -EOPNOTSUPP is returned.
