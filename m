Hello!

As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
This means that I have full access to your device.

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult=20
site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or=20
other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the=20
camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your=20
correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every=20
4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half=20
of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you=20
watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your=20
emails and contacts on social networks.
I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and=20
messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this,
transfer the amount of $708 to my bitcoin address (if you do not=20
know how to do this, write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").

Step 1: Create an account on www.localbitcoins.com
Step 2: Buy 0.12 BITCOIN
Step 3: Send the amount on this BTC address:=20
3EYbsPv9fN9KwhCnYp4cCHn4XvLRXAkCrD
Step 4: Contact me on this email address=20
polyprosolution@gmail.com with this subject: 012VIPERMARVO-
RESTOREKEYPC4102934
After this steps you will receive through email the key and a=20
decrypt tutorial.

Here is another list where you can buy bitcoin:
https://bitcoin.org/en/exchanges

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will=20
never hear me again.
I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when=20
you see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this=20
email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else,=20
the video will be immediately distributed.

Best regards!
