Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    longest initial â†’ initial

"The B<wcscspn>()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the "
"B<strcspn>(3)  function.  It determines the length of the longest initial "
"segment of I<wcs> which consists entirely of wide-characters not listed in "
"I<reject>.  In other words, it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-"
"character string I<wcs> of any of the characters in the wide-character "
"string I<reject>."

"The B<wcscspn>()  function returns the number of wide characters in the "
"longest initial segment of I<wcs> which consists entirely of wide-characters "
"not listed in I<reject>.  In other words, it returns the position of the "
"first occurrence in the wide-character string I<wcs> of any of the "
"characters in the wide-character string I<reject>, or I<wcslen(wcs)> if "
"there is none."
