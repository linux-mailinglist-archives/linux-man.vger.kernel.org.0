Thanks for all of the detail in the commit message! That's funky! But I
suppose in the end it's not completely surprising, because of the fact
that epoll is really notifying events on the open file description,
and there may be multiple file descriptors that refer to that description
(as for example, after fork()). It is however, still surprising to users 
that you can read() from the FD, even though epoll doesn't say it's ready.

Thanks for the proposed text. But I prefer to avoid mentioning 
daemon(3), which has a longstanding bug described in its manual
page). Also, I think we need to bring out the fact that the
signalfd still makes signals available for reading, even though
epoll does not say the FD is ready. Also, your text might
lead the reader to think that this sequence might be possible:

create signalfd
create epoll instance
add signalfd to epoll instance
fork()
       In child: add signalfd to epoll instance

That last step will of course give an EEXIST error from
epoll_ctl(), because  that FD is already in the epoll
instance.

So, I've applied your patch, but then done a fairly major rewrite,
so that the text now looks like:

   epoll(7) semantics
       If a process adds (via epoll_ctl(2)) a signalfd file descriptor to
       an epoll(7) instance, then epoll_wait(2) returns events  only  for
       signals  sent to that process.  In particular, if the process then
       uses fork() to create a child process, then the child will be able
       to  read(2)  signals  that  are sent to it using the signalfd file
       descriptor, but epoll_wait(2) will not indicate that the  signalfd
       file descriptor is ready.  In this scenario, a possible workaround
       is that after the fork(2), the child process can  close  the  sig‚Äê
       nalfd  file  descriptor  that it inherited from the parent process
       and then create another signalfd file descriptor and add it to the
       epoll  instance.   Alternatively,  the  parent and the child could
       delay creating their  (separate)  signalfd  file  descriptors  and
       adding them to the epoll instance until after the call to fork(2).

Seem okay to you?

I also verified this weirness using the program shown below:

$ ./epoll_signalfd
PID of parent: 5661
PID of child:  5662
epoll_wait() returned 0
PID 5662: got signal 10
Successfully read signal, even though epoll_wait() didn't say FD was ready!
