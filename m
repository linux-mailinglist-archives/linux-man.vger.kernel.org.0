I've applied a large number of minor changes to the patch.  I have not
applied it yet, as I'd like you to have a look at it, and answer a
question or two.  I'd also like to review it again in case I made any
mistakes.

I've commented below on the changes, and have one or two questions that
need your attention.  I'll also reply with the patch updated with these
changes, so that you don't need to manually apply these changes.

See below.


Have a lovely day!
Alex
