With v6.19, userland will be able to request a delegation on a file or
directory. These new objects act a lot like file leases, but are based
on NFSv4 file and directory delegations.

Add new F_GETDELEG and F_SETDELEG manpages to document them.

+.fi
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B F_SETDELEG
+and
+.B F_GETDELEG
+are used to establish a new delegation,
+and retrieve the current delegation,
+on the open file description referred to by the file descriptor
+.IR fd .
+.P
+A file delegation is a mechanism whereby
+the process holding the delegation (the "delegation holder")
+is notified (via delivery of a signal)
+when a process (the "delegation breaker") tries to
+.BR open (2)
+or
+.BR truncate (2)
+the file referred to by that file descriptor, or attempts to
+.BR unlink (2)
+or
+.BR rename (2)
+the dentry that was originally opened for the file.
+.P
+Delegations can also be set on directory file descriptors.
+The holder of a directory delegation will be notified if there is a
+create, delete or rename of a dirent within the directory.
+.TP
+.B F_SETDELEG
+Set or remove a file or directory delegation according to the
+value specified in
+.IR deleg->d_type :
+.RS
+.TP
+.B F_RDLCK
+Establish a read delegation.
+This will cause the calling process to be notified when the file is opened for writing,
+or is truncated, unlinked or renamed.
+A read delegation can be placed only on a file descriptor that is opened read-only.
+If
+.IR fd
+refers to a directory,
+then the calling process will be notified if there are changes to filenames within the directory,
+or when the directory itself is renamed.
+.TP
+.B F_WRLCK
+Establish a write delegation.
+This will cause the caller to be notified when the file is opened for reading or writing,
+or is truncated, renamed or unlinked.
+A write delegation may be placed on a file only if there are no other open file descriptors for the file.
+The file must be opened for write in order to set a write delegation on it.
+Write delegations cannot be set on directory file descriptors.
+.TP
+.B F_UNLCK
+Remove our delegation from the file.
+.RE
+.P
+Like leases, delegations are associated with an open file description (see
+.BR open (2)).
+This means that duplicate file descriptors (created by, for example,
+.BR fork (2)
+or
+.BR dup (2))
+refer to the same delegation,
+and this delegation may be modified or released using any of these descriptors.
+Furthermore, the delegation is released by either an explicit
+.B F_UNLCK
+operation on any of these duplicate file descriptors,
+or when all such file descriptors have been closed.
+.P
+An unprivileged process may take out a delegation only on a file whose UID (owner) matches the filesystem UID of the process.
+A process with the
+.B CAP_LEASE
+capability may take out delegations on arbitrary files or directories.
+.TP
+.B F_GETDELEG
+Indicates what type of delegation is associated with the file descriptor
+.I fd
+by setting the
+.IR d_type
+field in
+.IR deleg
+to either
+.BR F_RDLCK ,
+.BR F_WRLCK ,
+or
+.BR F_UNLCK ,
+indicating, respectively, a read delegation, a write delegation, or no delegation.
+.P
+When a process (the "delegation breaker") performs an activity that conflicts with a delegation
+established via
+.BR F_SETDELEG ,
+the system call is blocked by the kernel and
+the kernel notifies the delegation holder by sending it a signal
+.RB ( SIGIO
+by default).
+The delegation holder should respond to receipt of this signal by doing
+whatever cleanup is required in preparation for the file to be
+accessed by another process (e.g., flushing cached buffers) and
+then either remove or downgrade its delegation.
+A delegation is removed by performing an
+.B F_SETDELEG
+operation specifying
+.I d_type
+in
+.I deleg
+as
+.BR F_UNLCK .
+If the delegation holder currently holds a write delegation on the file,
+and the delegation breaker is opening the file for reading,
+then it is sufficient for the delegation holder to downgrade
+the delegation to a read delegation.
+This is done by performing an
+.B F_SETDELEG
+operation specifying
+.I d_type
+in
+.I deleg
+as
+.BR F_RDLCK .
+.P
+If the delegation holder fails to downgrade or remove the delegation within
+the number of seconds specified in
+.IR /proc/sys/fs/lease\-break\-time ,
+then the kernel forcibly removes or downgrades the delegation holder's delegation.
+.P
+Once a delegation break has been initiated,
+.B F_GETDELEG
+returns the target delegation type in the
+.I d_type
+field in
+.I deleg
+(either
+.B F_RDLCK
+or
+.BR F_UNLCK ,
+depending on what would be compatible with the delegation breaker)
+until the delegation holder voluntarily downgrades or removes the delegation or
+the kernel forcibly does so after the delegation break timer expires.
+.P
+Once the delegation has been voluntarily or forcibly removed or downgraded,
+and assuming the delegation breaker has not unblocked its system call,
+the kernel permits the delegation breaker's system call to proceed.
+.P
+If the delegation breaker's blocked system call
+is interrupted by a signal handler,
+then the system call fails with the error
+.BR EINTR ,
+but the other steps still occur as described above.
+If the delegation breaker is killed by a signal while blocked in
+.BR open (2)
+or
+.BR truncate (2),
+then the other steps still occur as described above.
+If the delegation breaker specifies the
+.B O_NONBLOCK
+flag when calling
+.BR open (2),
+then the call immediately fails with the error
+.BR EWOULDBLOCK ,
+but the other steps still occur as described above.
+.P
+The default signal used to notify the delegation holder is
+.BR SIGIO ,
+but this can be changed using the
+.B F_SETSIG
+operation to
+.BR fcntl ().
+If a
+.B F_SETSIG
+operation is performed (even one specifying
+.BR SIGIO ),
+and the signal
+handler is established using
+.BR SA_SIGINFO ,
+then the handler will receive a
+.I siginfo_t
+structure as its second argument, and the
+.I si_fd
+field of this argument will hold the file descriptor of the file with the delegation
+that has been accessed by another process.
+(This is useful if the caller holds delegations against multiple files.)
+.SH NOTES
+Delegations were designed to implement NFSv4 delegations for the Linux NFS server.
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On success zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set to indicate the error. A successful
+.B F_GETDELEG
+call will also update the
+.I deleg->d_type
+field.
+.SH ERRORS
+See
+.BR fcntl (2).
+These operations can also return the following errors:
+.TP
+.B EAGAIN
+The operation was prohibited because the file was held open in a way that conflicts with the requested delegation.
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+The operation was prohibited because the caller tried to set a
+.B F_WRLCK
+delegation and
+.I fd
+represents a directory,
+or
+.I fd
+doesn't represent a file or directory, or
+the underlying filesystem doesn't support delegations.
+.SH STANDARDS
+Linux, IETF RFC\ 8881.
