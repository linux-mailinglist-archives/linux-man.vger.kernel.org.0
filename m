Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    user ID â†’ UID

"We have a cgroup directory, I</cg/1>, that is owned by user ID 9000."

"We have a process, I<X>, also owned by user ID 9000, that is namespaced "
"under the cgroup I</cg/1/2> (i.e., I<X> was placed in a new cgroup namespace "
"via B<clone>(2)  or B<unshare>(2)  with the B<CLONE_NEWCGROUP> flag)."

"In the absence of cgroup namespacing, because the cgroup directory I</cg/1> "
"is owned (and writable) by UID 9000 and process I<X> is also owned by user "
"ID 9000, process I<X> would be able to modify the contents of cgroups files "
"(i.e., change cgroup settings) not only in I</cg/1/2> but also in the "
"ancestor cgroup directory I</cg/1>.  Namespacing process I<X> under the "
"cgroup directory I</cg/1/2>, in combination with suitable mount operations "
"for the cgroup filesystem (as shown above), prevents it modifying files in "
"I</cg/1>, since it cannot even see the contents of that directory (or of "
"further removed cgroup ancestor directories).  Combined with correct "
"enforcement of hierarchical limits, this prevents process I<X> from escaping "
"the limits imposed by ancestor cgroups."

"is owned (and writable) by UID 9000 and process I<X> is also owned by user "
