The main problem was it did not only grows, but it did quadratically since
the new capability is combined with the others.  It was minimized because
the actually used capabilities was filtered out by the processor/kernel
advertise features. So maybe:

  The legacy hardware capabilities support has the drawback 
  it requires multiple search paths due the combined supported capabilities,
  and each new feature grows the number of paths added to the search list
  in quadratic manner.

Indeed, I will move to there.

I think it would be better to use 'architecture' here.

They are search paths, so glibc itself does not install them.  The
glibc Hardware capabilities search paths are constructed based on
pre-defined list (where only a handful architecture actually define
them) that are matched against the supported one by the hardware.
The initial patchset that actually implemented this feature has
more details [1].

It has the advantage that each glibc-hwcap path are not combined
with each other, so there is no quadratic increase when a new
patch is added.

So, let's say you have a x86_64-v3 chip (Haswell or Excavator) [2].
The result search patch will be 

  glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v3:glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v2:

It is also supported by ldconfig, so it will also check on all paths
defined on ld.so.conf along with combined one with glibc-hwcap.  So
let's say you have "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" on ld.so.conf, ldconfig will
check all possible subpaths based on the glibc-hwcap list:

  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v4
  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v3
  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v2
  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

And only adds a possible candidate iff the file exists.  For instance
if you have:

  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v4/libsomething.so
  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v2/libsomething.so
  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsomething.so

The ldconfig will setup a ld.so.cache with all the entries, but
ld.so will only select the x86-64-v4/libsomething.so if the CPU supports
the x86-64-v4 (Skylake, Zen4); otherwise it will fallback to
x86-64-v2/libsomething.so if the cpu support x86_64-v2 (Nehalem, Jaguar),
or libsomething.so as the x86_64 baseline.

So maybe a better description would be

  glibc 2.33 added a new hardware capability scheme,
  where each architecture might define
  a set of paths based on expected hardware support.
  Each path is added on the search path list
  depending of the hardware of the machine.
  Each path is independent and not combined together,
  so it does have the drawbacks of legacy scheme.
  .PP
  For instance, on x86 64-bit, if the hardware supports
  .B x86_64-v3
  (for instance Intel Haswell or AMD Excavator)
  , the resulting search path will be
  .BR glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v3:glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v2:.
  The following paths are currently supported, in priority order.
  .TP
  .B PowerPC (64-bit little-endian only)
  power10, power9
  .TP
  .B s390 (64-bit only)
  z16, z15, z14, z13
  .TP
  .B x86 (64-bit only)
  x86-64-v4, x86-64-v3, x86-64-v2
  .PP
  glibc 2.37 removed support for the legacy hardware capabilities.
