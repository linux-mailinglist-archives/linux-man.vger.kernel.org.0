Without further ado, the following was found:

"A 94-character set is designated as GI<n> character set by an escape "
"sequence ESC ( xx (for G0), ESC ) xx (for G1), ESC * xx (for G2), ESC + xx "
"(for G3), where xx is a symbol or a pair of symbols found in the ISO 2375 "

"African languages, ESC ( ! A selects the Cuban character set, and so on."
