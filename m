I'd say this comment seems redundant, given this structure is defined
in this manual page.

Is this really not const-qualified?  Does the kernel modify it?

This .br seems superfluous.

If the entire section is within a subsection, I think the subsection is
redundant, isn't it?

Just to confirm: one can't retrieve delegations through a different file
description that refers to the same inode, right?

I'd separate the paragraph here.  The above serves as a brief
introduction of these two APIs, while the following text describes what
delegations are.

Please use semantic newlines.  See man-pages(7):

$ MANWIDTH=3D72 man man-pages | sed -n '/Use semantic newlines/,/^$/p'
   Use semantic newlines
     In the source of a manual page, new sentences should be started on
     new lines, long sentences should be split  into  lines  at  clause
     breaks  (commas,  semicolons, colons, and so on), and long clauses
     should be split at phrase boundaries.  This convention,  sometimes
     known as "semantic newlines", makes it easier to see the effect of
     patches, which often operate at the level of individual sentences,
     clauses, or phrases.

s/IR/I/

IR is for alternating Italics and Roman.

Also, it would be good to use '.d_type' notation, for making it easier
to distinguish struct members.  A few manual pages already do this.
Thus:

	.I .d_type

Maybe we could even simplify this as:

	...
	specified in
	.IR deleg->d_type :

'Take out' means to remove, but by reading the context, I think this
instead creates a read delegation, right?  Would it be correct to say
this?:

	Create a read delegation.

(I'm not a native English speaker, so I may be mistaken.)

Are we in time to rename this?

F_RDLCK blocks essentially writing.
F_WRLCK blocks both reading and writing.

What do you think of this rename:

	RD =3D> WR
	WR =3D> RW

Please use a separate line for each:

	.BR F_RDLCK ,
	.BR F_WRLCK ,
	or
	.BR F_UNLCK ,

Spurious white space before comma.

I'd say the part after the comma is redundant with the STANDARDS
section.

I guess there are also errors specific to delegations, right?  I expect
for example an error if F_SETDELEG is called with F_WRLCK but more file
descriptors are open for the same file.
