I don't know of a page that does this, and some of them are a bit 
inconsistent, so I'd have to search through the source code of the pages 
to find one that is a perfect example.  So I'll write/draw a schema here:

You could do it like this:

.TP
	tag 1
.PP
		paragraph 1.1
.IP
		paragraph 1.2
.IP
		paragraph 1.3
.RS
.TP
		tag 1.4
.PP
			paragraph 1.4.1
.IP
			paragraph 1.4.2
.RS
.TP
			tag 1.4.3
.PP
				paragraph 1.4.3.1
.IP
				paragraph 1.4.3.2
.IP
				paragraph 1.4.3.3
.RE
.IP
			paragraph 1.4.4
.RE
.IP
		paragraph 1.5


Was it helpful?

Disclaimer:  I didn't test it; I'm talking from memory.
Disclaimer 2: indentation is just to show results; obviously, don't 
indent your input :)

I think tagged paragraphs as subsubsections is much more common (and 
logically organized).

Then I got it very wrongly :).  I thought you meant more like "far from 
being universally recognized".

"almost" seems good to me.

almost is good.
