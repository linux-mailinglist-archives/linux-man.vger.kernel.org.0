Currently, if I type "man stpecpy", I get a man page with a synopsis and it looks to me like glibc supports stpecpy(3) just like it supports stpcpy(3). But glibc doesn't do that, as stpecpy is merely a man-pages invention: although the source code for stpecpy is in the EXAMPLES section of string_copying(7), you can't use stpecpy in an app without copy-and-pasting the man page's source into your code.

The answer is performance: memcpy often works faster when copying a number of bytes that is a multiple of a smallish power of two, and "size" is more likely than "size - 1" to be such a multiple.

Thank you for your reply. I see what you mean, many programmers consider sizes and would make their dest buffer say 32 bytes, so when this truncation occurs it makes sense to make the most of that to copy quickly, even if that means writing the null terminator on top of the last written byte. Probably someone measured strlcpy with these truncation calls and saw a lot of convenient power of 2 sizes coming through, when truncating strings in this way.

Personally, I'm not sure if it is much use when strings are truncated, as strlcpy detects, an API like this could just return an error and not partially copy. Then the programmer would have a chance to realloc() and copy the full string. 

The strlcpy API returns src_length, even when it's truncated and didn't write src_length+1 bytes to dest, how misleading. Shame strlcpy can't be [[deprecated]].

I'm sure everyone may have read these posts before about strlcpy, just sharing while I remember:

Ulrich Drepper frowned upon strlcpy:
https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00053.html

"This is horribly inefficient BSD crap.  Using these function only
leads to other errors.  Correct string handling means that you always
know how long your strings are and therefore you can you memcpy
(instead of strcpy).

Beside, those who are using strcat or variants deserved to be punished."

The rest of the thread is also interesting.

Kind regards, Jonny
