Yes, it is a clarification.

As I said I'm not feeling comfortable with it. So I would really like if
somebody else ideally more skilled recheck it and improve it. Maybe
asking linux-fsdevel for help?

What is missing updating also the statx information (because this is
also syscall which returns inode number) and updating also readdir(2)
and getdents(2). In the first email I sent list of manpages which are
affected. It could be quite surprising for people reading documentation
why old stat syscall has something regarding to inodes and new statx
syscall does not have.
