I prefer keeping it, but I agree with moving it to a place where it
doesn't distract (maybe even a separate page).

LGTM.

How about having an O_RSYNC(2const) manual page that talks in detail
about it?

Yes, a syncronized-io(7) page would make sense.

I like the idea of a chapter 7 manual page, or separate 2const pages for
each different macro.  Whatever you consider more useful/readable.

Yup; I strongly prefer many minimal patches.  If you (or anyone) start
by removing parentheticals that are unnecessary or incorrect, that'd be
good.

I would do that, but I wouldn't be able to write the commit messages, or
decide how to group them.  I'd need someone expert in those APIs to
write the patches.  I can then amend them editorially if they have any
minor issues.

Okay.  While I can't do the removal of inaccurate text, I can reorganize
correct text.  If you do the former, I can do this afterwards.  I'll CC
you in such patches.

Michael Kerrisk wanted to keep everything after Linux 2.6.  Moving it to
HISTORY, and reducing less important details, is appropriate, but
removing it all is not so much.

I more or less keep that guideline, although I'm slightly more prone to
removals, but not too much.

Yup.  I've been moving a lot of text to separate pages or HISTORY
sections, or removing unnecessary details.
