I'm surprised that POSIX says _may_ and not _shall_ here.  Is it 
possible that '/..' != '/'?  Or is it just a wording issue of POSIX?

I can't help here; I use Debian too :).  Michael uses Fedora, I think, 
so maybe he can tell.

I don't know the history of this (actually, I've always wondered why), 
but .PP and .P are equivalent, AFAIK, and we use .PP.

See man-pages(7):

    Sections within a manual page
        The  list  below  shows conventional or suggested sections.
        Most manual pages should include at least  the  highlighted
        sections.   Arrange  a new manual page so that sections are
        placed in the order shown in the list.

               NAME
               SYNOPSIS
               CONFIGURATION    [Normally only in Section 4]
               DESCRIPTION

               RETURN VALUE     [Normally only in Sections 2, 3]
               ERRORS           [Typically only in Sections 2, 3]

        Where a traditional heading would  apply,  please  use  it;
        this kind of consistency can make the information easier to
        understand.  If you must, you can create your own  headings
        if they make things easier to understand (this can be espe‐
        cially useful for pages in Sections 4 and 5).  However, be‐
        fore  doing this, consider whether you could use the tradi‐
        tional headings, with some subsections (.SS)  within  those
        sections.

You could move sections into subsections of DESCRIPTION, and the current 
subsections into tagged paragraphs (.TP).

> +.P
> +A filename on a Linux system can consist of almost any sequence of UTF-8

See man-pages(7):

    Use semantic newlines
        In the source of a manual page,  new  sentences  should  be
        started  on  new  lines, and long sentences should be split
        into lines at clause breaks  (commas,  semicolons,  colons,
        and  so on).  This convention, sometimes known as "semantic
        newlines", makes it easier to see the  effect  of  patches,
        which often operate at the level of individual sentences or
        sentence clauses.

Please, use a separate line and
.B \e0

We avoid \f.

See man-pages(7) (although it is explained in an unrelated context):

        Any  reference  to  the  subject of the current manual page
        should be written with the name in bold followed by a  pair
        of parentheses in Roman (normal) font.  For example, in the
        fcntl(2) man page, references to the subject  of  the  page
        would  be  written as: fcntl().  The preferred way to write
        this in the source file is:

            .BR fcntl ()

        (Using this format, rather than the  use  of  "\fB...\fP()"
        makes  it  easier to write tools that parse man page source
        files.)

Why did you use the non-breaking space here (and other places)?  I don't 
think it's necessary.

I'd have used parentheses there. No?  Was it, as in Mathematics, to 
clearly differentiate the inner from the outer parentheses?  If so, we 
typically nest parentheses in the manual pages (as in here (see?)).

However, I don't think it's wrong per se to use brackets...  Is it 
common in other places?  Maybe the add some readability to the text, and 
we hould use them.

Why talk about '.' here but not '..'?

Anyway, '.' is not a convention but a reserved name, so I think it 
shouldn't be mentioned here.

Most manual pages talking about capitalization typically use the term 
'case' (uppercase, lowercase, case sensitive, ...); probably because of 
'toupper()' and 'tolower()'.  I think, for consistency, using the same 
terminology would be better.

Or is it Unicode terminology you were using?

Do you mean normal user conventions?  I mean, the standard C++ library 
(and the language) doesn't use uppercase, AFAIR.  Not even in the cases 
where C used it (e.g., _Bool)

The SUSv4 part of the standard is the same that is in POSIX.1-2008?  Or 
does it have any extensions regarding filenames that isn't in POSIX?

If both standards have the same exact contents about filenames, I'd 
simplify this with POSIX.1-2008 only.
