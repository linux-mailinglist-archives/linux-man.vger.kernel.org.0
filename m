I can't find anything related to this in my mailbox.  Maybe you
mentioned it at some point, but I have not been involved with the
actual systemd changes.  So not meant to belittle your work at all.

Looks great as a first step.

What do you mean by "Utilizing the mount notifications queueing"?

Do you mean batching of notifications?   I think that's a very
important issue: processing each individual notifcation may not make
sense when there are lots of them.  For example, doing ceate
mount+remote mount in a loop a million times will result in two
million notification messages (with high likelyhood of queue
overflow), but in the end the mount table will end up being the
same...

Thanks,
Miklos
