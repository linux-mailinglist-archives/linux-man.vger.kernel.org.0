Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:   longest initial â†’ initial

"The B<wcsspn>()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the "
"B<strspn>(3)  function.  It determines the length of the longest initial "
"segment of I<wcs> which consists entirely of wide-characters listed in "
"I<accept>.  In other words, it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-"
"character string I<wcs> of a wide-character not contained in the wide-"
"character string I<accept>."

"The B<wcsspn>()  function returns the number of wide characters in the "
"longest initial segment of I<wcs> which consists entirely of wide-characters "
"listed in I<accept>.  In other words, it returns the position of the first "
"occurrence in the wide-character string I<wcs> of a wide-character not "
"contained in the wide-character string I<accept>, or I<wcslen(wcs)> if there "
"is none."
