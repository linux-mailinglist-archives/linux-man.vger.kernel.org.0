Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    ISO â†’ ISO/IEC

"ASCII (American Standard Code For Information Interchange) is the original 7-"
"bit character set, originally designed for American English.  Also known as "
"US-ASCII.  It is currently described by the ISO 646:1991 IRV (International "
"Reference Version) standard."

"The ISO 2022 and 4873 standards describe a font-control model based on VT100 "
"practice.  This model is (partially) supported by the Linux kernel and by "
"B<xterm>(1).  Several ISO 2022-based character encodings have been defined, "
"especially for Japanese."

"A 94-character set is designated as GI<n> character set by an escape "
"sequence ESC ( xx (for G0), ESC ) xx (for G1), ESC * xx (for G2), ESC + xx "
"(for G3), where xx is a symbol or a pair of symbols found in the ISO 2375 "
"International Register of Coded Character Sets.  For example, ESC ( @ "
"selects the ISO 646 character set as G0, ESC ( A selects the UK standard "
"character set (with pound instead of number sign), ESC ( B selects ASCII "
"(with dollar instead of currency sign), ESC ( M selects a character set for "
"African languages, ESC ( ! A selects the Cuban character set, and so on."

"ISO 4873 stipulates a narrower use of character sets, where G0 is fixed "
"(always ASCII), so that G1, G2, and G3 can be invoked only for codes with "
"the high order bit set.  In particular, B<\\(haN> and B<\\(haO> are not used "
"anymore, ESC ( xx can be used only with xx=B, and ESC ) xx, ESC * xx, ESC + "
"xx are equivalent to ESC - xx, ESC . xx, ESC / xx, respectively."

"Unicode (ISO 10646) is a standard which aims to unambiguously represent "
"every character in every human language.  Unicode's structure permits 20.1 "
"bits to encode every character.  Since most computers don't include 20.1-bit "
"integers, Unicode is usually encoded as 32-bit integers internally and "
"either a series of 16-bit integers (UTF-16) (needing two 16-bit integers "
"only when encoding certain rare characters) or a series of 8-bit bytes "
"(UTF-8)."

"A byte 110xxxxx is the start of a 2-byte code, and 110xxxxx 10yyyyyy is "
"assembled into 00000xxx xxyyyyyy.  A byte 1110xxxx is the start of a 3-byte "
"code, and 1110xxxx 10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz is assembled into xxxxyyyy yyzzzzzz.  "
"(When UTF-8 is used to code the 31-bit ISO 10646 then this progression "
"continues up to 6-byte codes.)"

"For most texts in ISO 8859 character sets, this means that the characters "
"outside of ASCII are now coded with two bytes.  This tends to expand "
"ordinary text files by only one or two percent.  For Russian or Greek texts, "
"this expands ordinary text files by 100%, since text in those languages is "
"mostly outside of ASCII.  For Japanese users this means that the 16-bit "
"codes now in common use will take three bytes.  While there are algorithmic "
"conversions from some character sets (especially ISO 8859-1) to Unicode, "
"general conversion requires carrying around conversion tables, which can be "
"quite large for 16-bit codes."
