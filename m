Issue:    Linux 2.24 â†’ Glibc 2.24

"From glibc 2.3.4 up to and including Linux 2.24, the glibc wrapper function "
"for B<getpid>()  cached PIDs, with the goal of avoiding additional system "
"calls when a process calls B<getpid>()  repeatedly.  Normally this caching "
"was invisible, but its correct operation relied on support in the wrapper "
"functions for B<fork>(2), B<vfork>(2), and B<clone>(2): if an application "
"bypassed the glibc wrappers for these system calls by using B<syscall>(2), "
"then a call to B<getpid>()  in the child would return the wrong value (to be "
"precise: it would return the PID of the parent process).  In addition, there "
"were cases where B<getpid>()  could return the wrong value even when "
"invoking B<clone>(2)  via the glibc wrapper function.  (For a discussion of "
"one such case, see BUGS in B<clone>(2).)  Furthermore, the complexity of the "
"caching code had been the source of a few bugs within glibc over the years."
