Even that is an overstatement.  The difference between being in section 3p
only and being in both section 3p and 3 is barely user-visible.

Here is a manual page that is in section 3p and in section 3p only,
on OpenBSD-current:

   $ man -w warnings
  /usr/share/man/man3p/warnings.3p
   $ grep  '^\.TH' $(man -w warnings)
  .TH warnings 3p "2021-03-02" "perl v5.32.1" "Perl Programmers Reference Guide"

But lo and behold:

   $ man -s 3 -w warnings
  /usr/share/man/man3p/warnings.3p

Mandoc still finds the page in section 3 because "3" is a substring of "3p",
and that not only makes sense from the string processing perspective
but also from a logical perspective because section 3p is a particular
corner of section 3 after all.

To cause mandoc to *not* find the page in section 3, the user would have
to type something like

   $ man -k 'sec~3$' -a warnings
  man: nothing appropriate

Even i don't normally use such advanced syntax (regex matching on section
names using the "sec" search keyword and the explicit regex operator
and the -a logical operator for the conjunction of two search criteria).
I doubt whether man-db even supports similar features...

I would somewhat advise against that.  While i do think that consistency
is good *if* you decide to use a section suffix, i'd still recommend
to use section suffixes sparingly, at least in operating systems
that use them sparingly now.  They provide relatively little value,
make the top directory of the manpath larger and less readable,
and they are in particular *not* well suited to moving stuff out of
the non-suffix directories that users may not wish to see by default.
For example, suppose you created a directory man3py to document
python library functions.  As explained above, these pages will *still*
show up even when people type "man 3" or "man 3p" rather than "man 3py".

More or less, according to
https://src.illumos.org/source/xref/illumos-gate/usr/src/man/ -
it's not identical though.

I doubt it, for two reasons.  On the one hand, my impression is that
at least in Solaris, section suffixes are not so much used for
logical subdivision of sections but more according to provenance;
for example, man1b is for BSD compat features, man1s is for commands
specific to SunOS, man3c is for libc, man3ext is for an "extended
library", man3p is for the Sun performance library (available for
both C and FORTRAN 95), and so on.

On the other hand, naming manual pages after symbolic constants
or after type names is so unsual that i doubt any scheme exists
for that.  The most widely used way to look up manual pages
by the names of symbolic constants or type names probably is
using macro keys as implemented in the mandoc version of apropos(1).
That is used by most FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Alpine Linux, and Void Linux.
I admit that doesn't qualify as "widely used", but "most widely used"
is probably true all the same.  ;-)

Yours,
  Ingo
