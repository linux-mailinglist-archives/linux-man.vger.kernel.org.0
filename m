Hi Michael,

I tried to render HTML pages with the Makefile.
I had some errors, even though the operation succeed (I have the
resulting HTML files, and the contents look good in the browser.
Has it happened to you before?  Do you know how to solve it?
I copied here the full error messages, in case it is useful.

I guess this is what you use for generating the online pages, isn't it?

Thanks,

Alex
