With v6.19, userland will be able to request a delegation on a file or
directory. These new objects act a lot like file leases, but are based
on NFSv4 file and directory delegations.

Add new F_GETDELEG and F_SETDELEG manpages to document them.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.SS Delegations
+.B F_SETDELEG
+and
+.B F_GETDELEG
+are used to establish a new delegation,
+and retrieve the current delegation, on the open file description
+referred to by the file descriptor
+.IR fd .
+A file delegation is a mechanism whereby the process holding
+the delegation (the "delegation holder") is notified (via delivery of a signal)
+when a process (the "delegation breaker") tries to
+.BR open (2)
+or
+.BR truncate (2)
+the file referred to by that file descriptor, or attempts to
+.BR unlink (2)
+or
+.BR rename (2)
+the dentry that was originally opened for the file.
+.BR F_RDLCK
+delegations can also be set on directory file descriptors, in which case they will
+be recalled if there is a create, delete or rename of a dirent within the directory.
+.TP
+.B F_SETDELEG
+Set or remove a file or directory delegation according to which of the following
+values is specified in the
+.IR d_type
+field of
+.IR deleg :
+.RS
+.TP
+.B F_RDLCK
+Take out a read delegation.
+This will cause the calling process to be notified when
+the file is opened for writing or is truncated, or when the file is unlinked or renamed.
+A read delegation can be placed only on a file descriptor that
+is opened read-only. If
+.IR fd
+refers to a directory, then the calling process
+will be notified if there are changes to filenames within the directory, or when the
+directory itself is renamed.
+.TP
+.B F_WRLCK
+Take out a write delegation.
+This will cause the caller to be notified when
+the file is opened for reading or writing or is truncated or when the file is renamed
+or unlinked.  A write delegation may be placed on a file only if there are no
+other open file descriptors for the file. The file must be opened for write in order
+to set a write delegation on it. Write delegations cannot be set on directory
+file descriptors.
+.TP
+.B F_UNLCK
+Remove our delegation from the file.
+.RE
+.P
+Like leases, delegations are associated with an open file description (see
+.BR open (2)).
+This means that duplicate file descriptors (created by, for example,
+.BR fork (2)
+or
+.BR dup (2))
+refer to the same delegation, and this delegation may be modified
+or released using any of these descriptors.
+Furthermore, the delegation is released by either an explicit
+.B F_UNLCK
+operation on any of these duplicate file descriptors, or when all
+such file descriptors have been closed.
+.P
+An unprivileged process may take out a delegation only on a file whose
+UID (owner) matches the filesystem UID of the process.
+A process with the
+.B CAP_LEASE
+capability may take out delegations on arbitrary files or directories.
+.TP
+.B F_GETDELEG
+Indicates what type of delegation is associated with the file descriptor
+.I fd
+by setting the
+.IR d_type
+field in
+.IR deleg
+to either
+.BR F_RDLCK ", " F_WRLCK ", or " F_UNLCK ,
+indicating, respectively, a read delegation , a write delegation, or no delegation.
+.P
+When a process (the "delegation breaker") performs an activity
+that conflicts with a delegation established via
+.BR F_SETDELEG ,
+the system call is blocked by the kernel and
+the kernel notifies the delegation holder by sending it a signal
+.RB ( SIGIO
+by default).
+The delegation holder should respond to receipt of this signal by doing
+whatever cleanup is required in preparation for the file to be
+accessed by another process (e.g., flushing cached buffers) and
+then either remove or downgrade its delegation.
+A delegation is removed by performing an
+.B F_SETDELEG
+operation specifying
+.I d_type
+in
+.I deleg
+as
+.BR F_UNLCK .
+If the delegation holder currently holds a write delegation on the file,
+and the delegation breaker is opening the file for reading,
+then it is sufficient for the delegation holder to downgrade
+the delegation to a read delegation.
+This is done by performing an
+.B F_SETDELEG
+operation specifying
+.I d_type
+in
+.I deleg
+as
+.BR F_RDLCK .
+.P
+If the delegation holder fails to downgrade or remove the delegation within
+the number of seconds specified in
+.IR /proc/sys/fs/lease\-break\-time ,
+then the kernel forcibly removes or downgrades the delegation holder's delegation.
+.P
+Once a delegation break has been initiated,
+.B F_GETDELEG
+returns the target delegation type in the
+.I d_type
+field in
+.I deleg
+(either
+.B F_RDLCK
+or
+.BR F_UNLCK ,
+depending on what would be compatible with the delegation breaker)
+until the delegation holder voluntarily downgrades or removes the delegation or
+the kernel forcibly does so after the delegation break timer expires.
+.P
+Once the delegation has been voluntarily or forcibly removed or downgraded,
+and assuming the delegation breaker has not unblocked its system call,
+the kernel permits the delegation breaker's system call to proceed.
+.P
+If the delegation breaker's blocked system call
+is interrupted by a signal handler,
+then the system call fails with the error
+.BR EINTR ,
+but the other steps still occur as described above.
+If the delegation breaker is killed by a signal while blocked in
+.BR open (2)
+or
+.BR truncate (2),
+then the other steps still occur as described above.
+If the delegation breaker specifies the
+.B O_NONBLOCK
+flag when calling
+.BR open (2),
+then the call immediately fails with the error
+.BR EWOULDBLOCK ,
+but the other steps still occur as described above.
+.P
+The default signal used to notify the delegation holder is
+.BR SIGIO ,
+but this can be changed using the
+.B F_SETSIG
+operation to
+.BR fcntl ().
+If a
+.B F_SETSIG
+operation is performed (even one specifying
+.BR SIGIO ),
+and the signal
+handler is established using
+.BR SA_SIGINFO ,
+then the handler will receive a
+.I siginfo_t
+structure as its second argument, and the
+.I si_fd
+field of this argument will hold the file descriptor of the file with the delegation
+that has been accessed by another process.
+(This is useful if the caller holds delegations against multiple files.)
+.SH NOTES
+Delegations were designed to implement NFSv4 delegations for the Linux NFS server, and
+conform to the delegation semantics described in RFC\ 8881.
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On success zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set to indicate the error. A successful F_GETDELEG call will also update the
+.I d_type
+field in the structure to which
+.I deleg
+points.
+.SH ERRORS
+See
+.BR fcntl (2).
+.SH STANDARDS
+Linux, IETF RFC\ 8881.
+.SH HISTORY
+Linux v6.19.
