That would have been a pitty.

I would have assumed that you process them at your convenience, i.e.
each when you have time.

Well, in the past (i.e. 10 years) we (german) translators always said
"we should report this". But "we" always amounted to no one doing it.
We were only recording issues found. So I finally decided to proceed.=20

Since you are our biggest upstream, I started with your pages.
Intially I would have made one big bug report, but I understood this
is not requested from your side.=20

Since it was mostly script based (and I was working on the scripts
while preparing) they came in all at once. I could have added a
throttle, like 10 / day, of course.

I'm still learning the process(es), so the next upstream might get a
better experience and I apologize for all the glitches I made.

Anyhow, I hope to report more frequent (and with much lower numbers) in
the future.

> In any case, thank you very much for your many reports.

Thanks from my side that you accepted and processed them.

Greetings
