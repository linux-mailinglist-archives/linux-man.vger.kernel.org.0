Without further ado, the following was found:

Issue:    mount point I<B> â†’ mount I<B>

"Here, I<B> is the destination mount, and I<b> is a subdirectory path under "
"the mount point I<B>.  The propagation type of the resulting mount, I<B/b>, "
"follows the same rules as for a bind mount, where the propagation type of "
"the source mount is considered always to be private."

"Here, I<A> is a mount on I<B/b>, where I<B> is the parent mount and I<b> is "
"a subdirectory path under the mount point I<B>.  If B<B> is shared, then all "
"most-recently-mounted mounts at I<b> on mounts that receive propagation from "
"mount I<B> and do not have submounts under them are unmounted."
